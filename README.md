<strong>
  <p>Use nitro stickers and all of your Discord server stickers for free with this plugin!</p>

  <p>Animated stickers will be sent as GIFs, non animated stickers are linked like in the free emojis plugin! If a sticker can already be sent, it will go through just fine!</p>
</strong>
  <p>Note: The animated stickers will appear in chat right away for you, but you have to wait a bit for the upload to complete.</p>
